This project was developed as a part of the Master's Thesis titled: **"Optimizing mobile map reading: An adaptive map approach in response to dynamic pedestrian context"**.

It was designed to:
- Measure the impact of different noise levels and movement speeds on mobile map reading performance
- Evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive map prototype in mitigating potential negative impacts of context factors on mobile map reading
