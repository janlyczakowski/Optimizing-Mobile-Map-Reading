# Optimizing mobile map reading: An adaptive map approach in response to dynamic pedestrian context

This project was developed as a part of the Master's Thesis titled: **"Optimizing mobile map reading: An adaptive map approach in response to dynamic pedestrian context"**.
As the practical part of the thesis, the Android application with Mapbox Maps SDK for Android was developed to investigate the effect of context on mobile map use.

It was designed to:
- Measure the impact of different noise levels and movement speeds on mobile map reading performance
- Evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive map prototype in mitigating potential negative impacts of context factors on mobile map reading
